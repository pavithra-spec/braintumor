# Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying brain tumor images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the network. The user can interact with the model via a Gradio interface to predict the type of brain tumor in uploaded MRI images.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to classify brain tumor images into four different categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary**

The model is trained on a dataset of MRI images, and once trained, it can classify new MRI images with a Gradio web interface. The user simply needs to upload an image of the brain scan, and the model will predict the category of the tumor.

## Installation

To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Gradio
- scikit-learn
- numpy

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-classifier.git
   cd brain-tumor-classifier
````

2. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

```
tensorflow
gradio
opencv-python
scikit-learn
numpy
```

## Usage

1. Make sure your dataset is available and correctly placed at the path `DATASET_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Brain Tumor Segmentation/Training'`. The dataset should contain subfolders for each tumor category (`glioma`, `meningioma`, `notumor`, `pituitary`).

2. Run the script to train the model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Once the model is trained, run the Gradio interface:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. The Gradio interface will open in your browser. Upload a brain MRI image, and the model will classify the tumor type.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains MRI images of the brain labeled with the following categories:

* **Glioma**: A type of tumor that occurs in the brain.
* **Meningioma**: A tumor that forms in the meninges (the lining of the brain and spinal cord).
* **No Tumor**: Images with no detectable brain tumor.
* **Pituitary**: Tumors of the pituitary gland.

### Dataset Structure

The dataset should be structured as follows:

```
/Brain Tumor Segmentation/
    /glioma/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    /meningioma/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    /notumor/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    /pituitary/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
```

## Model Architecture

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification. It consists of the following layers:

* 3 Conv2D layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128)
* MaxPooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the images
* BatchNormalization layers to stabilize and accelerate training
* GlobalAveragePooling layer for feature extraction
* Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation
* Dropout layer to prevent overfitting
* Output layer with a softmax activation function to predict one of the 4 classes

The model uses categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer for training.

## Training

Training involves feeding MRI images into the model and adjusting the weights based on the error. The following hyperparameters are used during training:

* **Batch Size**: 16
* **Epochs**: 10
* **Image Size**: 128x128
* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy

Training logs and accuracy metrics are printed during each epoch.

## Prediction

Once the model is trained, predictions can be made using the Gradio interface. The function `predict_image` takes an image, processes it, and returns a prediction label.
